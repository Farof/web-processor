# TODO

- correct repositionning of elements in workspace when resizing
- better contextual cursor in workspace
- arrow at end of link
- server-side save
- order input
- item alignement help
- make the app headless, able to operate without ui, in browser or node
  - the core app is headless and the ui is a process
- named input / output
- optional input
- position collapse if reload when process is closed
- export / import process
- identify library item type by uuid to ensure process integrity if an item is renamed
- don't redraw canvas on every mousemove: is it possible without breaking link hover detection ?
- handle request redirect
- move canvas related stuff in Process.js its own file
- make items event emiters, don't use global hub
- handle bad data persisted: junk data, behavior that shouldn't work
- clone process to save for debug later
- bootstrap rss & other complex process
- passive value transfer option
